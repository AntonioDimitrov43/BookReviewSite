                           <b> THE TIMES SCIENCE BOOK OF THE YEAR<br>
								A GUARDIAN BEST POLITICS BOOK OF THE YEAR<br>
								A TOP 5 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER<br><br>

								A pulse-racing journey through the science and politics of the pandemic. 
								Did the UK government really 'follow the science' throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, as it claims?<br><br>
						   </b>
								The Coronavirus pandemic has devastated lives and livelihoods around the world - and continues to do so. 
								These personal tragedies will, and must, be told and heard. 
								There is, however, also a truthful and objective scientific narrative to be written 
								about how the virus played out and how the world set about dealing with it. 
								Spike is that story - from the inside. Its author, Jeremy Farrar, is one of the UK's leading 
								scientists and a member of the SAGE emergency committee.

								As head of the Wellcome Trust, and an expert in emerging infectious diseases, 
								Jeremy Farrar was one of the first people in the world to hear about a mysterious new respiratory 
								disease in China - and to learn that it could readily spread between people. Farrar describes how it 
								feels as one of the key scientists at the sharp end of a fast-moving situation, when complex decisions must 
								be made quickly amid great uncertainty. His book casts light on the UK government's claims 
								to be 'following the science' in its response to the virus, and is informed not just by 
								Farrar's views but by interviews with other top scientists and political figures.
